The Takes itself will be redundant from then on.
Append additional Wedge TOPs as you like to generate further variation.
Warning: Depending on number of Takes and edited Parameters this can take quite long (Up to ~3mins, only once. Unfortunately HOM does not provide direct access to take parm values, but you have to iterate over takes, set them and then evaluate). Also loading the UI of the Wedge TOP Node can take a couple of seconds every time you select the wedge Node."""]]></helpText>
